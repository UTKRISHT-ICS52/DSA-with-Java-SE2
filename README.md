<h3>About Me :</h3>
<p>I am a 2nd-year Undergraduate Computer Science student with strong interests in software engineering, applied research, and scalable systems. I have worked as an Undergraduate Researcher in IoT (sensor-based systems) and Machine Learning, with published research paper focused on solving real-world problems.

I have a solid foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (Java) and hands-on experience as a Full-Stack Java Developer, where I actively build and optimize projects with an emphasis on clean code, performance, and backend architecture.

I contribute to the developer community as a Mentor at Social Code’25 and a Contributor at GSSoC’25, collaborating in open-source environments and supporting peers through code reviews and technical guidance.

I have competed in multiple hackathons and was recognized as a Hackathon Winner (PACS’24) and Finalist at SmartEarth’25 (Kazakhstan), gaining experience in team-based problem solving, rapid prototyping, and technical decision-making.</p>
